# flatten {#sec-doc}

```

Transform a pair `key` and `value` into a dictionary.

```{julia}
#| eval: false
flatten_dict(key, value:: Dict{<:Any, <:Any})

```

Given a `key` and a `value` which is a dictionary, concatenate the `key` string to every other key of the  dictionary `value`. A dictionary of dictionaries will become only a dictionary of values.
 
Thus, we are "flattening" the inner dictionaries.

```{julia}
#| eval: false
flatten_dict(dict::Dict{<:Any, <:Any}, n = 1)

```

Remove one layer of dictionaries of a dictionary.
